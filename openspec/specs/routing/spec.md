# routing Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change improve-next-quality-guardrails. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Space detail route consumes params synchronously
The `/space/[id]` page SHALL accept the App Router `params` object directly and SHALL validate that `params.id` is a non-empty string before rendering.

#### Scenario: Valid space id renders view
- **GIVEN** a request to `/space/alpha`
- **WHEN** the route loads
- **THEN** it reads `params.id` without awaiting a promise and renders `SpaceView` with `spaceId="alpha"`.

#### Scenario: Invalid params trigger not-found
- **GIVEN** a request where `params.id` is missing or empty
- **WHEN** the route loads
- **THEN** it invokes `notFound()` so the user receives the 404 boundary instead of rendering with bad data.

### Requirement: File-based routing
The application SHALL use TanStack Router for client-side and server-side routing with file-based route definitions.

#### Scenario: Home route loads
- **WHEN** user navigates to /
- **THEN** the home page component is rendered

#### Scenario: Dynamic routes work
- **WHEN** user navigates to /space/[id]
- **THEN** the space page loads with the correct id parameter

#### Scenario: Nested routes supported
- **WHEN** routes are nested in directories
- **THEN** TanStack Router handles the hierarchy correctly
